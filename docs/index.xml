The purpose of the book was to outline a need for moving towards a cow-based, environmentally sustainable, cruelty-free agrarian economy, and the need for research in this area in multiple disciplines.
The book addresses the significance of the cow and cow-based-products from multiple angles: health, environment, history, spirituality and agriculture. It posits that the environmental damage accrued from beef and leather industries is not properly weighed in the balance when assessing the profits from these industries, and that the environmental damage caused is grievous and long-term.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://agarwalarti.github.io/courses/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agarwalarti.github.io/courses/</guid><description>Courses: System Design for Sustainability (July-October 2023)
